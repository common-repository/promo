## Shortcodes 
This plugin creates two shortcodes for you to integrate Promos into your site 


**`[promolist]`**

This shortcode will display a grid of thumbnail previews for each of your public Promos. Clicking one of the previews takes the user to a page with all the promo details. It accepts 2 parameters:

`@size: <integer> The number of Promos to list. Defaults to 6. Use 0 for all Promos.`
`@columns: <integer> The number of columns in the grid. Defaults to 3. Must be a value between 1 and 6. Columns will respond to the browser screen size.`

Example: Show all promos in a 4 column grid:
`[promolist size="0" columns="4"]`

**`[promo]`**

This shortcode will show a single thumbnail preview for a Promo. Clicking the preview takes the user to a page with all the promo details. Note that it's possible for you to display a Private promo using this shortcode.

`@id: <integer> The Promo ID. Required.`
`@max-width: <css width value> Defaults to 400px`
`@align: <left | center | right> Defaults to center.`

Example: `[promo id="3" max-width="100%"]`
